# ESP32-C6 MCP Server

This project implements an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server running on ESP32-C6 that connects to WiFi, gets an IP address via DHCP, and exposes MCP functionality that can be accessed by Warp.

## Project Structure

- `esp32-c6-mcp-rs/` - ESP32-C6 firmware with WiFi and MCP server
- `esp32-mcp-bridge/` - Rust bridge tool for connecting Warp to ESP32 MCP server
- `desktop-qr-code-mcp/` - Reference desktop MCP server for QR code generation

## Features

- **WiFi Connection**: Automatically connects to WiFi and obtains IP via DHCP
- **MCP Server**: Implements MCP protocol over TCP on port 3000
- **WiFi Status Tool**: MCP tool to check WiFi connection status and network info
- **Bridge Tool**: Pure Rust bridge for connecting Warp to ESP32 MCP server

## Prerequisites

- Rust toolchain with ESP32 target support
- ESP-HAL v1.0.0-rc.0
- WiFi network credentials (SSID and PASSWORD)

## Building and Flashing ESP32-C6 Firmware

1. Set environment variables for WiFi credentials:
   ```bash
   export SSID="YourWiFiNetwork"
   export PASSWORD="YourWiFiPassword"
   ```

2. Build and flash the firmware:
   ```bash
   cd esp32-c6-mcp-rs
   cargo build --release  # Always build with --release for embedded targets
   cargo run --release    # This will flash the firmware
   ```

3. Monitor the output to see the IP address assigned by DHCP:
   ```bash
   cargo monitor
   ```

## Building the Bridge Tool

The bridge tool allows Warp to communicate with the ESP32 MCP server:

```bash
cd esp32-mcp-bridge
cargo build --release
```

## Using the Bridge with Warp

1. First, make sure your ESP32-C6 is running and connected to WiFi
2. Note the IP address from the ESP32 serial output
3. Configure Warp to use the bridge tool as an MCP server

### Option 1: Direct Command Line Usage

```bash
./target/release/esp32-mcp-bridge --esp32-ip 192.168.1.100 --port 3000
```

### Option 2: Warp Configuration

Add this to your Warp MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "esp32-mcp": {
      "command": "/path/to/esp32-mcp-server/esp32-mcp-bridge/target/release/esp32-mcp-bridge",
      "args": ["--esp32-ip", "192.168.1.100", "--port", "3000"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Available MCP Tools

## LED Status Indicators

The ESP32-C6's onboard LED provides visual feedback:
- ðŸ”µ **Blue (20% brightness)**: System ready, no MCP client connected
- ðŸŸ¢ **Green (20% brightness)**: MCP client connected and active
- âš« **Off**: Device not running or LED manually turned off

## Example AI Assistant Prompts

Once connected to Warp with MCP, you can use these natural language prompts:

### LED Control Examples
```
"Turn the ESP32 LED red"
"Set the ESP32 LED to blue with 50% brightness"
"Change the LED to green and make it dim (20% brightness)"
"Set the ESP32 LED to RGB(128, 64, 255) with 75% brightness"
"Make the LED purple using RGB values"
"Turn off the ESP32 LED"
```

### WiFi Status Examples
```
"Check the WiFi status of my ESP32"
"Is my ESP32 connected to WiFi?"
"Show me detailed WiFi information from the ESP32 including signal strength"
```

### Mathematical Computation Examples
```
"Ask the ESP32 to calculate 15.5 + 23.7"
"Use my ESP32 to add two numbers: 42 and 38"
"Have the ESP32 multiply 12.5 by 8.2"
"Calculate 25 Ã— 16 using the ESP32"
```

### Combined Operations Examples
```
"Check my ESP32's WiFi status, then turn the LED green if connected"
"Set the ESP32 LED to yellow, check WiFi status, then calculate 100 + 200"
"If my ESP32 is connected to WiFi, turn the LED blue, otherwise turn it red"
```

### Creative Examples
```
"Make the ESP32 LED show different colors to indicate system status"
"Use the ESP32 LED as a status indicator - green for good WiFi, red for problems"
"Create a light show on my ESP32 by setting different colors and brightness levels"
"Set up the ESP32 LED to indicate calculation results with different colors"
```

## Architecture

```
Warp Terminal
    â†“ (stdin/stdout JSON-RPC)
ESP32 MCP Bridge (Rust)
    â†“ (TCP JSON-RPC)

```

The bridge tool handles the protocol translation between Warp's stdin/stdout MCP communication and the ESP32's TCP-based MCP server.

## Development

### ESP32-C6 Development

- The firmware uses Embassy async runtime for efficient task handling
- WiFi credentials are set via environment variables at compile time
- JSON processing uses `serde-json-core` for no_std compatibility
- Heap allocation is used for network buffers (128KB heap)

### Bridge Development  

- Built with Tokio for async TCP networking
- Handles bidirectional JSON-RPC message forwarding
- Includes connection timeout and error handling
- Supports verbose logging for debugging

## Troubleshooting

### ESP32 Not Connecting to WiFi
- Check SSID and PASSWORD environment variables
- Verify WiFi network is 2.4GHz (ESP32-C6 doesn't support 5GHz)
- Check serial output for connection errors

### Bridge Connection Issues
- Ensure ESP32 has obtained an IP address via DHCP
- Verify the IP address in bridge command matches ESP32's IP
- Check firewall settings on your network
- Try with `--verbose` flag for detailed logging

### Warp Integration Issues
- Verify the bridge tool path in Warp configuration
- Check that the bridge tool builds successfully
- Ensure ESP32 is running and accessible before starting Warp

## Network Security Notes

- This is a development/prototype implementation
- WiFi credentials are embedded in firmware at compile time
- The MCP server accepts connections from any client on the network
- For production use, consider adding authentication and encryption
